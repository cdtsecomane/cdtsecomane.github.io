<h1 id="about-the-workshop">About the Workshop</h1>
<p>According to the new EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade, in the next years
will be critical to build operational capacity to prevent, deter and respond to cyber threats,
which highlighted the need to boost the development of state-of-the-art cyber defence
technologies. This urgent action together with the emergence of innovative concepts in the
field of secure communications notably at the network edge evidences a necessary coordination
and synchronization to balance common interests and dual use endeavours.
In this context, nowadays most of the EU cybersecurity and cyber defence forums are not
cross-sectorial and therefore it is difficult to find dual-use related discussions to engage the
civil and military research community. The 1st International Workshop on Cyber Defence
Technologies and Secure Communications at the Network Edge (CDT &amp; SECOMANE) aims
to close this gap by opening a forum were both communities exchange information for a mutual
benefit. Hence the ESORICS community could openly contribute and participate at cyber
defence and secure network dual-use related discussions contributing to enrich and enlarge
participation.
